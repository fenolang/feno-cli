Feno has a much simpler and more powerful syntax to program EVERYTHING you imagine.

## License

The Feno programming language is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Start now

So you had Feno installed now uh? First, you need to install the necessary dependencies to work, just type the following code in your console:
```
$ npm i
```

Later just create a "Hello World" in your `index.feno` located in `pages/` folder:

```html
doc {
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
}
```

Strange? Interesting? Yeah! But this is just a fairly basic start, now you can go to the official documentation, learn how Feno works and create your next project like never before ;))!

See you and thank you very much!
